## Objectives

1. On the entry homepage, users can click on a country from a list to retrieve a country specific page.  
2. On any page, users can also search for a country from the search box by typing in the country code or country name.
3. The country specific page will display travel advisories and COVID statistics, and if the country is safe to visit.
4. Additional useful information will be displayed such as language and currency (type and conversion rate) along with points of interests.
5. Users can create an account and login.
6. If logged in, a user can bookmark countries to get those countries prioritized at top.
